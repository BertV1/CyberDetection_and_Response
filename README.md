>  Working with NVD' CVE / CVSS data feeds in Python to serve various purposes

## Background

1. Our primary data source will be the **JSON data feeds** from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) (= primary source)
   * https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds
2. We will be working exclusively in **Python** (3.9)
   * optional libraries and modules are allowed
